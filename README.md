# Foreman templates

# DEFUNCT - DO NOT USE!!!!

This repository is deprecated! All templates we need to adapt are now maintained in [ansible_foreman](https://github.com/norcams/ansible-foreman)_ and activated by Ansible jobs in [foreman_setup](https://github.com/norcams/foreman-setup)_. Please make any alterations you need in there instead!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Templates patched and modified for the needs of [himlar](https://github.com/norcams/himlar). The templates are all for Foreman, and is a substitue for the defunct [community-templates](norcams/ansible/blob/master/README.md) repository.

The *norcams* subdirectory is the location from where the templates and snippets are synced/imported. The *upstream* directory is ment to contain the upstream data which we are backporting from; this is to make it easier to patch and deduct which of the upstream changes we need to preserve or alter.
